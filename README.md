# monolog
Chainable CLI Prompting Library for Go

This is just a little library I wrote for use with my own CLI tooling. It only uses Golang standard library packages and is somewhat extensible. If you would like to use this in your own project, take a look at the following:

+ [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/cosmotek/monolog)

+ [godoc for prototype prompts](https://godoc.org/github.com/cosmotek/monolog/prototypes)


This library can easily be installed using the Go tool:
`go get -v -u github.com/cosmotek/monolog`

Feel free to ask questions or report bugs using Github issues, I hope you enjoy!
